## SABQ Eats Review Project

In this project, we simulated a restaurant review system. It prompted the user with five options. The options were "Insert a Reveiw", "Search Reviews by Restaurant", "Search Review by Food Category", "Search most recent number of reviews", "See all reviews", and finally "Quit Program". The program comes with five total files as well. The main.cpp, review.cpp, review.h, review_db.cpp, and the review_db.h files are included. The main functionality of the project was to give user interactive options to insert reviews about UberEats, GrubHub, or any other food delivey service. If the user wanted to insert a review, they would enter their name, restaurant name, food category, the delivery price, their personal rating for the delivery out of ten, their comments about the food, and the overall satisfaction. After this is inputed by the user, the array is increased by 1. The remainder functions all display reviews with respect to their titles. Finally, the quit funtion exits the program with a goodybye message.
